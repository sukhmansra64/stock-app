# stock-app
##App is no longer updated/works on heroku, is discontinued.
 -an application for tracking stock market updates with an input form which uses autosuggestions to help you find the stock you are looking for.
 -known issues are that the autosuggestions do not work until at least 4 characters have been entered into the form, but this seems to be an API issue rather than a problem with the code.
 -further improvements can be making this into a fullstack app by implementing a backend which can save your favorite stocks, or find more information related to the stock
 -made using React.js, Node.js, and React Bootstrap
